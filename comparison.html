<p>		The great thing about websites is they are completely customizable. It is very uncommon to find two websites that are exactly the same. Some of my favorite websites are ones that are interactive and colorful. I like to be engaged when viewing websites or I get bored. There are some amazing things people are capable of creating to make a website interesting. From creating little tricks and games throughout the website, to telling a story on each page through imagery and animation, the combinations are endless. With that being said, there are some pretty terrible websites out there as well. Because anyone can make a website, people with no knowledge of what a visually appealing website looks like put things together that are absolutely atrocious. </p>

<p> 	One of the best websites I have seen is called <a href="http://www.visithumboldt.com/" target="_new" title="Cool Website"> Visit Humboldt. </a> This website is great for many reasons. First of all, I love that it is promoting tourism for Humboldt County. It is a genius way to get people to visit this destination. Additionally, it helps you plan a vacation to this destination through basically taking a quiz through the website and when you click on each decision it takes you to a different area. The background visuals of the page are videos promoting the beauty of this destination and the wide variety of nature there is to offer. It is simply a genius way to get people to come to Humboldt County. The color scheme is bold with simple white and yellow text and accents and it blends beautifully. It shows little videos and you can click on the videos if you feel like going there and it starts to build an itinerary for you. After you finish, it allows you to go back and pick more or change the type of trip you want to go on. If you want to learn more about the redwood area that you will be visit it directs you to the visitredwood information site. The html code for this website appears to be extremely complex. There are over 481 lines! I clicked on the link to the .css and that was even more intense! There was a lot of time and effort put into this website and it shows. The work put into this website will directly benefit their tourism and this is an awesome way of going about building a website for a destination location. This website is very user friendly and makes me want to plan a trip to Humboldt County. There are options for a romantic getaway, adventure weekend, relaxing retreat or family fun. I can plan four different trips for the same place and see all different things. This website is top notch and other cities and state promoting toursim should look into having a website like this one.

Another fun website I found is called <a href="https://thecoolclub.co/" target="_new" title="The Cool Club"> The Cool Club. </a> It is a company from the Netherlands that creates cool illustrations and personalized prints for products such as, card games, posters. The company was started with a group of friends playing cards which evolved in them inventing their own card game called The Cool Club. I do not really understand what the game is or their mission, but there site was interesting! There is a lot of tiny details added in from the loading screens, to clicking on an icon and it actually being a little game where cards pop out of the deck. It is a cool way for them to showcase the different deck of cards they are making and allow the user to see the design in a real life scenario. Each header on the different pages had a little animation at the top. Another cool aspect to the page was animations of the navigation links when you hover over them they move like a wave. There is also a completely different category of products for star wars which when you click on that it leads into a star wars like setting and the video is done very well. It is almost 3D and the list of products is laid out like the end credits of the star wars movie. Looking at the HTML code, they used a table element and a lot of icons. It was very long and confusing, but appears to show a lot of work and time was put into it.

Last, but not least, the worst site I have ever seen has to be one called <a href="http://arngren.net/" target="_new" title="Arngen."> Argen.<a/>	

I believe it is a website selling products similar to a craigslist, but it is poorly put together. There are pictures every where that are not even in a line or organized in any sort of manner. It is not compatible in regular viewing mode. There is more content then can fill the page. When you click on a category it goes to a new page, that is just as unorderly as the first one. There are icons throughout that make no sense and are completely irrelevant. When viewing the HTML code, it appears they used a website builder to create their website and I do not understand what they did. I found it very hard to read. At the bottom of the page, there is a random Christmas animation. It is very confusing. I do not understand why this person did what they did. It looks like they are trying to sell things, but I would not know where to start if I was going to buy something from this site. This website is not user friendly at all. When you do try and buy something, it takes you to a checkout page with banking information that is not laid out well. It is hard to read and understand how to buy the product. Additionally, when the page is downsized the words overlape each other and the page becomes even harder to navigate and understand. This website needs to be destroyed.
