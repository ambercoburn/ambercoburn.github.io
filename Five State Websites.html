	<h1>State Websites from best to worst</h1>

	<li><a href="https://az.gov/" target="_new" title="Favorite State Website"> Arizona </a></li>
	
	<p>Arizona's website is my favorite because it was the website that I wanted to be on the most. It was visually appealing, interactive and geared towards tourism. It made me want to visit Arizona, unlike the other websites which were focused on the state government. Additionally, it was the most user friendly in being able to change the font size and level of contrast which I never would have thought to include in a website. They utilized a lot of pictures from around the state which I think is very beneficial for tourism because it made me want to go to those spots and see them in person.	</p>
	
	<li><a href="https://www.nebraska.gov/" target="_new" title="Second Favorite State Website">Nebraska</a></li>
	<p>Nebraska's website is my second favorite because it is also very visual appealing and made me want to keep exploring on the page. It is interactive and I want to keep clicking on the buttons to see the different pages they have to offer. The main page has a lot of information on it, but it displays it in a simple way while highlighting important statistics about unemployment and health data. It gives a lot of information without overwhelming the reader. The page is seperated into five categories including: government, business, employment, education, and attractions. This makes the user able to navigate the webpage easier and get to what they are looking for quicker. With that being said, there is also a search bar right at the top of the page so, if the user needs to look up something quickly they can just type it in and get to where they need to be. </p>
	
	<li><a href="https://mt.gov/" target="_new" title="Third Favorite State Website"> Montana</a></li>
	<p>Montana's website is fairly plain. It uses really pretty pictures from around the state but does not offer a lot of variety in the way it is laid out. All the font is quite similar and they use all caps often especially under the main buttons at the top to navigate through categories. They need to make it more user friendly. However, they include a photo gallery and interactive map which is interesting. Overall, I think it is a pretty boring website compared to others and could be laid out better to represent our state. </p>
	
	
	<li><a href="https://alaska.gov/" target="_new" title="Second to Least Favorite Website"> Alaska </a></li>
	<p> Alaska's website was very disengaging for me. It has a very bland color scheme and made me want to switch pages immediately. It does not shrink down in size when it is made smaller and doesn't use a lot of images. I find it very boring. However, it is doing what it is supposed to and providing information about the state and looks professional. It is simple and somewhat user friendly. It also has a translation of one of the native language's at the top which I liked. They would benefit from using different colors and adding in some smaller details to engage users in their website. </p>
	
	<li><a href="https://www.nh.gov/index.htm" target="_new" title="My Least Favorite Website"> New Hampshire</a></li>
	<p> New Hampshires website is very boring and has a lot of white space.  I think the main page could summarize what the page has to offer in a different way. It looks a bit unprofessional and does not make me want to explore further. Additionally, it does not shrink down in size when made smaller on my screen which is a downfall. I like the main picture behind the search bar and it is very helpful to have a search bar to get where you need to go quickly. They would benefit from organizing it better and making it look sharper. They could use more background images. However, they have a translation link at the top to translate words to different languages and allow people to change the font size for easier reading. I have not seen the translator on any other pages, so that is a positive. I also like the use of the logo behind the page and using the colors from the logo throughout the page.   </p>
